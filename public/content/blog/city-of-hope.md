## City of Hope

A city covered in its own dust  
with people filled with hunger and lust  
  
Skyscrapers meet scraps of the slum  
noise takes over the birds' hum  
  
Chaos, mayhem - there is a wild rush  
Daring ocean is the land's crush  
  
The crowd is running, searching for its soul  
Waiting for the destiny's dices to roll  
  
Beneath this bedlam, there exists hard work  
Workings of night and day, making this circus berserk  
  
Emotions run high here, aspirations even higher  
A very few do make it, but everyone's a trier  
  
All are visitors, lost are its own  
Beside the ocean - winds of liberty are blown  
  
But also comes along a saffron-green thunder  
The turn of events sometimes makes one wonder  
  
Is it the crowd or the Arabian sea,  
Who is staring at the ocean of people?  
  
The day is running, night is dope  
Still it is called the city of hope  
  
â€” *Rohit Mungre*
